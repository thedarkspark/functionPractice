# functionPractice

This file is primarily used for us to test out new functions as we go thru the lessons and the book. 

Nice playground for us to build some sand castles I guess. 

I took the liberty of adding a few lines of code in there to test out conditional statements. Im sure you'll notice it. All you gotta do is read each like a text.
